# minesweeper
The classic Minesweeper game recreated in Excel using VBA.  You can either add the Setup and Minesweeper macros to your own spreadsheet, and use the Setup macro to establish the initial conditions, or you can simply download the Excel spreadsheet ready to use.  If you add the macros to your own spreadsheet, you may add shortcut keys as desired, and change the button names and shortcut key references in the instructions to reflect your choices.  The rules of the game are as follows:
1.  Poke a square to start the game by pressing the button or Ctrl+Z.
2.  The numbers indicate the number of mines in the surrounding cells.
3.  Use flags by pressing the button or Ctrl+X to denote cells with mines.
4.  The mine counter in cell D1 tells you how many mines remain to be found.
5.  When you have flagged all of the mines and cleared all of the remaining cells, you win!
6.  The game can be reset at any time by pressing the button or Ctrl+V.
